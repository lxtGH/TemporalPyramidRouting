#   Improving Video Instance Segmentation via Temporal Pyramid Routing [[Arxiv]]()

To incorporate both temporal and scale information, we propose a Temporal Pyramid Routing (TPR) strategy to conditionally
align and conduct pixel-level aggregation from a feature pyramid pair of two adjacent frames. Specifically, TPR
contains two novel components, including Dynamic Aligned Cell Routing (DACR) and Cross Pyramid Routing (CPR),
where DACR is designed for aligning and gating pyramid features across temporal dimension, while CPR transfers
temporally aggregated features across scale dimension.

The code and model will be available soon.
